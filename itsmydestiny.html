        <h1>A Guardian Rises</h1>
        
        <p>I feel like everyone has one game. The one that scratches an important itch. For me, that is the game Destiny 2. I have spent several years collecting gear, facing down tough challenges, and making new friends. For those who are unfamiliar with the game, I want to break it down for you.</p>
        
        <p>Destiny, at its core, is a looter shooter, but it's the space magic and smooth gunplay that really up the enjoymnet. You play as a resurrected warrior of light: A Guardian. And you defend the Solar System from aliens and robots! Sounds cool, right?</p>

        <h2>THREE WHOLE CLASSES</h2>
        <p>When you start the game, you are given 3 class choices:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <div class="class-container">
                    <h3>Hunter</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <li>Edgy</li>
                        <li>Brooding</li>
                        <li>THE DRIP</li>

        <h2>An Extensive Buildcrafting System</h2>
        <p>What's crazy is that the variety doesn't end there. Once you select your class, you then have up to FIVE subclasses to choose from, each with an entirely different gameplay fantasy. Then, on top of that, you have over 1000 different weapons to choose from and fit into your builds. The variety and possibilities are exhilirating.
